In this sanctuary, there lived a queen, [[Beraham Sher]], whose domain reached the entire park along with his brother, [[Bhai Sher]] who would guide the west wing of the park. A girl name [[Aasha]] lived in the town bordering the park, [[Borivali]]. She works at the sanctuary to feed the lions, test the water and inform the public about the park. Aasha has a special ability, she can understand and speak to animals. She uses her ability to pass time listening to the animals conversations on the sanctuary, specifically, she is interested in lions. One of the most dangerous but regal animals on the sanctuary that posses the power to even end her own life if they wanted to. &quot;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Sanjay Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary" tags="" position="176,657" size="100,100">The Sanjay Gandhi National Park area has a long written history dating back to the 4th century BC. In ancient India, Sopoara and Kalyan were two ports in the vicinity that traded with ancient civilisations such as Greece and Mesopotamia. The 45 km (28 mi) land route between these two ports was partially through this forest. The Kanheri Caves in the centre of the park were an important Buddhist learning centre and pilgrimage site sculpted by Buddhist monks between 9th and the 1st centuries BCE. They were chiselled out of a massive basaltic rock outcropping. 
The park was named &#39;Krishnagiri National Park&#39; in the pre-independence era. At that time the area of the park was only 20.26 km2 (7.82 sq mi). In 1969, the park was expanded to its present size by acquiring various reserve forest properties adjoining the park. After this, an independent unit of the Forest Department called &#39;Borivali National Park Sub-division&#39; administered the area. Krishnagiri National Park was created in 1974 and later renamed as &#39;Borivali National Park&#39;. In 1981, it was re-dedicated as &#39;Sanjay Gandhi National Park&#39; in memory of Sanjay Gandhi, the son of ex Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi, who was killed in an air-crash in 1980.^^2^^

Borivali is approximately 18 kilometres (11 mi) from Mumbai Airport. The estimated population of Borivali in 2010 was 513,077.

It is believed that the name &quot;Borivali&quot; comes from existence of a lot of bushes of a sweet fruit called &quot;Borr(Marathi/Gujarati)&quot; meaning berries in English. Hence, named the town of berries literally &#39;bori-vali&#39;. The existence of the ancient temple of Lord Ganesha &quot;Shree Svayambhu Ganpati devalaya&quot; in Vazira naka area, meaning the &#39;self manifested &#39; or the &#39;one that is created from its own accord&#39; in Hinduism and Our Lady of Immaculate Conception Church, at Mt. Poinsur, Christian church are the true examples of the mix of ethnicity and vibrant cultural mix of the population living here since ages.

The pre-historic era&#39;s &quot;Mandpeshwar&quot; and &quot;Kanheri caves&quot; stand a testament to the rich history of this place. Borivali was spelt &#39;Berewlee&#39; by the then ruled India under the British Raj Era. It is also spelled and pronounced as &quot;Borivli&quot;.

Borivali is lush green still even after being populated densely due to the presence of &quot;The Sanjay Gandhi National Park&quot; (SGNP), previously known as the &quot;BORIVALI NATIONAL PARK&quot; in east and the lush mangroves in the west end of Borivali .

Borivali was once inhabited by various ethnic groups who had huge parcels of lands and cultivated fruit orchards and were called &quot;wadis&quot; simply meaning orchard in Marathi/Gujarati. Almost all the land here was rich and fertile, suitable for agriculture and cultivation of fruits; especially mangoes (Aamba), sapota (Chickoos), coconut trees (Naaral) are abundant here.^^1^^

They contain Buddhist sculptures and relief carvings, paintings and inscriptions, dating from the 1st century BCE to the 10th century CE. Kanheri comes from the Sanskrit Krishnagiri, which means black mountain.

The site is on a hillside, and is accessed via rock-cut steps. The cave complex comprises one hundred and nine caves, carved from the basalt rock and dating from the 1st century BCE to the 10th century CE. The oldest are relatively plain and unadorned, in contrast to later caves on the site, and the highly embellished Elephanta Caves of Mumbai. Each cave has a stone plinth that functioned as a bed. A congregation hall with huge stone pillars contains a stupa (a Buddhist shrine). Rock-cut channels above the caves fed rainwater into cisterns, which provided the complex with water. Once the caves were converted to permanent monasteries, their walls were carved with intricate reliefs of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas. Kanheri had become an important Buddhist settlement on the Konkan coast by the 3rd century CE.

Most of the caves were Buddhist viharas, meant for living, studying, and meditating. The larger caves, which functioned as chaityas, or halls for congregational worship, are lined with intricately carved Buddhist sculptures, reliefs, pillars and rock-cut stupas. Avalokiteshwara is the most distinctive figure. The large number of viharas demonstrates there was a well organized establishment of Buddhist monks. This establishment was also connected with many trade centers, such as the ports of Sopara, Kalyan, Nasik, Paithan and Ujjain. Kanheri was a University center by the time the area was under the rule of the Maurayan and Kushan empires. In the late 10th century, the Buddhist teacher Atisha (980–1054) came to the Krishnagiri Vihara to study Buddhist meditation under Rahulagupta.^^4^^

The wild animals required special kind of attention from the Government because of the decrease in their number. It was found that some of the rare and exquisite variety of animals like the Royal Bengal Tigers was on the verge of extinction.

They needed to be saved from total annihilation. So, the Government shouldered the responsibility to save these endangered species. National Parks have been constructed in order to create and ecological balance and preserve the natural assets. Sanjay Gandhi National Park is one of them.

Sanjay Gandhi National Park was named after Sanjay Gandhi, son of the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the year 1969. It was previously a trading connector of the two most important trading spots of the Greeks and the Mesopotamians. Wildlife in Sanjay Gandhi National Park consists of unique varieties of Flora and Fauna. They are generally endangered species and so are under the protection act of the Government.

Wildlife in Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Park includes the following:

Rhesus Macaque
Bounet Macaque
Spotted Deer
Bounet Macaque
Hanuman Langur
Indian Flying Fox
Black Naped Hare
Barking Deer

There are approximately 800 varieties of flowering plants, 5,000 species of insects and almost 284 kinds of birds in Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The world&#39;s largest moth seems to reside in the same forest. ^^6^^

The lion was starving and had a voracious appetite. He had not eaten an animal since he had left for his journey. He saw the spotted deer as a great oppurtunity for a meal.... Surely, you must be wondering if the lion was able to eat the spotted deer. However...

It is dawn and I will be back tomorrow night to finish my story.&#39;&#39;

&#39;&#39; How did the lion encounter the genie?

You see, he was a gentle lion who softened his heart for those that had compassion for him. On his path from Mumbai to Goa, he encountered a frail Spotted deer. He had not caught any prey on his journey so far and he lucked out. Just as he was about to pounce on the Spotted deer, he saw how old and weak the Spotted deer was and took pity on him. Instead the lion said &quot;If you tell me a magnificient story, I will not eat you.&quot;
 
 The Spotted deer was glad that the lion spared him. The Spotted deer began to tell his story. 
 
 &quot;You may be wondering, why is this Spotted deer so skinny? Well, I am no ordinary Spotted deer but I was actually once a human. 
 
 You see, I was an orphan child- quite a mischievous kid. In order to survive, I would trick tourists by begging for money. Once they got their wallet out, I would quickly snatch their wallet and run as fast as I could across the streets of Mumbai. You see, crossing a street in Mumbai is no easy feat when busses and rickshaws come speeding by without stopping for people. Tourists wouldn&#39;t dare to cross the street in India because they would be hit by a car or a bus. 
 
 One day, I got tired of stealing and trying to survive on the streets. I went into the forest in search of an abandoned house. Once I found the house, I went inside to find that despite&#39;s it dilapidated condition, it was certainly not abandoned.
 
 Inside this house,there was only one room. There were shelves filled with all types of spices that I&#39;ve never seen before. Numerous amounts of plants and flowers growing on a ledge of a window. In the center of the house, there was a wooden square shaped table. Plated perfectly at the center of the house was a plate with [[mithai]]. It seemed like it was almost meant for me, so I grabbed it and ate it. &quot;

The Spotted deer continues his story...

&quot;After I ate the [[mithai]], I realized that the [[mithai]] had been put under a spell. I ran out as I realized my body was changing into that of a deer. I have been wandering around in hopes of finding something that will change me back to my human form. As time passed, I gave up hope and realized that even if I were to turn back into a human, I would still struggle for food and continue to live in a society that I would never fit into. I grew to accept this form but as you can see, I am frail and close to death.&quot;

After the lion heard the Spotted deer&#39;s story he decided that 

[[He would eat the Spotted Deer despite hearing his magnificient story]]

[[He would spare the Spotted Deer and invite him on his great journey]]

After eating the Spotted Deer, the lion began to feel something in his body change. He took form of the little boy. It seems that the effects of the spell manifested itself onto the lion by taking form of the prior creature&#39;s true form. It is about to turn to night and the boy is in the middle of the forest with no clothes on his back or food to eat. The lion now can understand the burdens of the spotted deer he ate.

Karma is a funny thing. 

The little boy climbs the tree to avoid getting eaten at night. He will continue on his journey in the day. Will the boy survive the night?

The Lion replies, &quot;What a magnificent story. Will you accompany me on my journey to the beaches of Goa?&quot;

The Spotted Deer accepted his proposal and the two of them continued on the path. What a sight, seeing a lion walk next to his prey on a journey to see a beach. What an odd pair. 

The next day, the lion and deer continued walking through the forest. They stopped in a town called [[Ratnagiri]]. 

They stopped near the ocean because they heard this town is known for its fish. The lion was very interested in the variety of fish so he head over to the port with the deer once it was night and no humans were in sight.

While walking along the beach, the lion finds a glass bottle. 

[[Open the glass bottle]]

The lion and deer were unable to open the bottle so instead they decided to smash it open. 

After smashing it open, a genie appeared before them. The genie then said &quot;
I&#39;ve been trapped in this cursed piece of glass by Solomon for years. I never expected it to be an animal that would release me into the world, much less the unlikely pair of a predator and prey. However, for freeing me, I shall offer each of you creatures, 1 wish. Choose wisely.&quot;

The Spotted Deer- although now comfortable with his deer form, still wished to be turned back into a human. However rather than returning to his old form of a weak orphaned boy, he decided that he would take on the form of a diligent, strong young man. 

The lion, decided that he has spent all of his time on land. It would take much longer for him to travel to Goa by land, so he decided to wish for a boat that even a lion could control.

The lion and human boy set across the land to continue their journey to Goa, the boy agrees to fish for the lion and himself. 

They never imagined living life like this. An unlikely pair in an even more unlikely situation grew to become best friends. Eventually, the pair reaches the coast of Goa. Rather than ending their journey, the human boy trades at the port of Goa and decides to continue his journey with his pal, the lion.


&#39;&#39;
After hearing the story, Beraham Sher decided that he will stop killing humans and decides to be friends with Aasha- she works with the Beraham Sher to feed the lions more meat and continues to tell stories to all the lions.
 Aasha continues to work at the Sanjay National Park after it opens to the public again. Beraham Sher lets his heart soften and becomes a kinder ruler of the forest.

The lion is now a little boy, oh how the tables have turned.

The little boy continues to walk towards the closest city, [[Ratnagiri]]. He relives the life that that the orphan boy had. He continues to trick people and steal food for survival. No one takes the little boy seriously. In comparision to his last life, the lion could be considered the king of the jungle. 
The lion from here on out understands the consequence of his actions,especially after going back on his word.


The lion continues to live his life as a little boy,from this point on, he never belittled anyone&#39;s point of view. He began to grow a deeper appreciation for all lives.


&#39;&#39;
After hearing the story, Beraham Sher decided that he will stop killing humans. It was unfair of him to let his temper rage on and affect other&#39;s lives. Aasha continues to work at the Sanjay National Park and all the other lions and humans live in harmony from there on out as the king of the park, Beraham Shers heart has softened.

According to Pachauri and Mayer (2015), The temperature observed has been one of the highest ever seen. One of the main cause of climate change is due to human actions like the release of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. In recent years, Climate change has affected both the environment and living creatures on Earth. (pp. 1-7) By continuing to emit greenhouse gasses, there are more risks for the irreversible damage on living creatures and the environment.  It also exacerbates the preexisting risks that already exist for the environment and living creatures. Global temperatures and sea level will continue to rise unless stopped soon. Pachauri and Mayer (2015) stated that in order to live with climate change, living creatures and the environment will have to adapt. Through adaption and mitigation, the risks of climate change can be reduced. Even though there are certain pathways for adaptation and reducing the effects of climate change, there is not one sufficient way to fix the effects of climate change. Instead, successful implementation on reducing climate change relies on the creation of Environmental Policy and cooperation of people on both a global, national and local scale. Mitigation response options for climate change can be solved by using more cost-effective options, reducing energy use and limiting the net emission of greenhouse gasses (pp. 17-31). There is no way to completely stop climate change, all we can do is reduce the effects and be environemental conscious of our actions.

These rectangular blocks emit smoke in the similar grey color that charaterizes the whole area around it. All you see is a land of grey. &#39;&#39;

[[Look closer]]

They look similar to the reflection you saw of yourself in the river. You realize, that YOU are a creature of destruction. Youre memories start to rush in and everything comes back to you in that passing moment. You don&#39;t remember how you got to the forest. But you remember living in a nice home, with a nice family that cared about you. But, you also realize that you are indirectly the cause of this destruction. What will you do? Will you continue to feed into this destruction? Or will you choose to live in the forest away from the destruction?&#39;&#39;


[[Go back home]]
[[Live in the forest]]

You realize that there is no way to stop it, the only thing you can do is reduce its effects.&#39;&#39;

[[The end]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="The end" tags="" position="1243,1250" size="100,100">Climate change is occurring world wide and has negative impacts. Climate change occurs because of CO2 emission and greenhouse gas emission into the atmosphere. Climate change causes water levels to increase and also warm the surface temperature of oceans. According to Pachauri and Mayer (2015), The temperature observed has been one of the highest ever seen. One of the main cause of climate change is due to human actions like the release of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. In recent years, Climate change has affected both the environment and living creatures on Earth. (pp. 1-7) By continuing to emit greenhouse gasses, there are more risks for the irreversible damage on living creatures and the environment.  It also exacerbates the preexisting risks that already exist for the environment and living creatures. Global temperatures and sea level will continue to rise unless stopped soon. Pachauri and Mayer (2015) stated that in order to live with climate change, living creatures and the environment will have to adapt. Through adaption and mitigation, the risks of climate change can be reduced. Even though there are certain pathways for adaptation and reducing the effects of climate change, there is not one sufficient way to fix the effects of climate change. Instead, successful implementation on reducing climate change relies on the creation of Environmental Policy and cooperation of people on both a global, national and local scale. Mitigation response options for climate change can be solved by using more cost-effective options, reducing energy use and limiting the net emission of greenhouse gasses (pp. 17-31). There is no way to completely stop climate change, all we can do is reduce the effects and be environemental conscious of our actions.
